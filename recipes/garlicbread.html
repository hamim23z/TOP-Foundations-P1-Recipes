        <li>
          Slice the tops off of garlic heads, so the tip of each clove is
          exposed. Place garlic heads, cut-sides up, on a baking sheet; drizzle
          tops with olive oil.

        <li>Set the oven to broil.</li>

          Slice bread loaf in half horizontally; place cut-side up on a baking
          sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Squeeze garlic cloves from their skins into a medium bowl. Stir in
          butter, Parmesan cheese, and parsley until well blended. Spread onto
          the cut sides of bread.
        </li>
