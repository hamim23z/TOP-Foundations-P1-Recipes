        <li>8 small Granny Smith apples</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of packed brown sugar</li>

      <h2 id="steps">Steps to Complete</h2>
      <ol id="steps-list">
        <li>
          Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
          C). Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form
          a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars
          and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to
          5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan.
          Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2
          inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay
          four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using
          longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back
          so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips
          perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the
          first and third strips back into their original position.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three
          unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth
          strips back into their original position. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to
          weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at
          the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making
          sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make
          sure it doesn't run off the sides.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to
          350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are
          soft, 35 to 45 minutes.
        </li>
