# The Odin Project - Foundations Course - Project 1


### Project Recap

The purpose of this project was to create a recipe page using what we had learned with HTML and CSS. We were supposed to test
our skills using HTML and CSS and the various different tags, and styles that we have learned. This  website is fully responsive 
and can be viewed across multiple different devices. I am doing The Odin Project to regain my strength with HTML and CSS.
