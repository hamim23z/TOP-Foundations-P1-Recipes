This is Project 1 for The Odin Project - Fundamentals Course. 
 
In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

This will not be a very flashy nor extensive website but there will be simple features such as links, images, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, etc. This project is just here to showcase the basic HTML elements that we have learned and used throughout this course.
